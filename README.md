# Malware-Categorizer

This program classifies malware samples from a directory and categorizes them into 9 different categories using Yara rules. The categories are:

- Blank Stealer
- Thiefcat
- Creal
- Ben Grabber
- Nova Stealer
- Empyrean Stealer

**Note:** The program is still in development and will be updated with more categories and more features.

## Installation

For the moment, I have not finished the code yet. I will update this section once I have finished the code.
